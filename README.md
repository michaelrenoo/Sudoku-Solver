# Sudoku-Solver
Sudoku is a logic-based number game originally from Japan. As I am trying to write code in Python, I stumbled upon this idea online to write a solver for sudoku puzzles in Python. I believe that this has been done before, but I do for my personal education purposes.

## How to run file:
Before you compile and run the file, please make sure that you have NumPy as one of your Python interpreter.
Once it is installed on your system, you can run the file as usual.
The sudoku puzzle that is inside the file can be seen in the repository under "SudokuTestPuzzle.jpg", or here:
